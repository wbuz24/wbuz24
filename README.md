# Will Buziak

I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Colorado School of Mines with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

My research work is focused on Secure Memory Computer Architecture Design, but I have a wide array of interests spanning all the way from Computation Fluid Dynamics to Neuromorphic Computing and a plethora of applications in-between.
