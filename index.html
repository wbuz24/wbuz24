        <h2 class="sectionhead" id="background"> Background </h2>

        <p class="paragraph" > I am a Computer Science PhD student at Colorado School of Mines with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. </p>

         <p class="paragraph"> I currently do research work on Secure Memory Computer Architecture Design under Dr. Iris Bahar and have many interests surrounding Computer and Mechanical Engineering related applications. </p>

        </p>

        <h2 class="sectionhead" id="undergradresearch"> Undergraduate Research </h2>

        <p class="paragraph"> I conducted undergraduate research in two labs simultaneously. The Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion Lab (<a href="https://ecpower.utk.edu/research/"><u>EESCL</u></a>) and The Neuromorphic Computing (<a href="https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/"><u>TENNLab</u></a>). </p>

        <p class="section"> <a href="https://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/"><u>TENNLab</u></a></p>

        <p class="paragraph"> My research in the TENNLab was centered around embedded computing applications for spiking neural networks. </p>

        <p class="section"> <a href="https://ecpower.utk.edu/research/"><u>EESCL</u></a></p>

        <p class="paragraph"> My research within the EESCL focused on the modeling and simulation of proton exchange membrane hydrogren electrolyzers. I additionally worked on front-end user interfaces for presenting the groups models, both within hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells, as well as lithium-ion power and energy delivery visualization for eVTOL vehicle applications. </p>

        <p class="section"> CICADaS </p>

          <img class="sidepics" border="0" alt="rob2" src="rob2.jpg"/>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"> - Autonomous, Neuromorphically Trained Swarm (ANTS) is a robotics project with the TENNLab in which I designed a modular, reproducible robot for swarming behavior applications. This robot integrates the TENNLab embedded neuromorphic kit to do both onboard processing and control.  </p>

        <p class="section"> NDBSCAN </p>

        <div id="images">
        <img class="square" border="0" alt="ndbscan" src="ndbscan.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"> - Utilizing the TENNLab neuromorphic framework, speed filtering and clustering algorithms were deployed on Dynamic Vision Sensing (DVS) camera data. The intent was to use combinations of the filters to isolate and track moving objects of varying shape and speed. </p>

       <p class="section"> LBM Modeling and Simulation </p>

        <div id="images">
          <img class="lbm" border="0" alt="velflow" src="velflow.png"/>
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph"> - I worked under PhD candidates developing two-phase fluid models and simulations to improve the design characteristics of PEM hydrogen electrolyzers. We used The Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM) modeling techniques to actively simulate mass transfer and electrochemical kinetic hydrogen generation rates.  </p>
